											<p>HackBCA was my first hackathon that I attended. The last time I programmed before this was a year before, and I forgot everything. However, my friend told me to go two days before the hackathon, and I registered the day after. I was unsure if I should go since I didn't know how to code, and I wouldn't get any sleep. But my parents encouraged me to go. I formed a team with some of my friends, and we created a 3-D molecule creater. It didn't turn out as well as we expected, but I still enjoyed my first hackathon. HackBCA inspired me to program.</p>
